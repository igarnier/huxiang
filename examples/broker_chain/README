The Broker example, together with on-chain monitoring.

To run (locally):
   * Edit `mother.ml` and replace the accounts by sufficiently funded accounts
     on your private geth chain.
   * `make`
   * To run the code: run 
     `mother` `sb_serv`, `sb_brok`, `client after` and `oracle`.
     This should deploy the mother contract on the blockchain.
     The (coalesced) service and client code will then kickstart the contract 
     monitoring by depositing credits on the contract and proceed to their
     off-chain contract, periodically sending keepalives to the chain.
