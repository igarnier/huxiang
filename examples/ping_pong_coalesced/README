A first example of process coalescence built on the Ping-Pong example.

To build: `make`

To run (locally):
   * For the normal execution, run the following executables: 
     `oracle`, `pp_ping`, `pp_pong` simultaneously. They can be started in any order.
     It is recommended to execute them in distinct terminals so as to have a clearer
     view of the logs.
   * For the execution with the adversarial `ping`, replace `pp_ping` by `pp_evil`.
   The execution of `pp_pong` should eventually block, after detecting this adversarial
   behaviour.
