Making two Ethereum blockchains communicate: the ping-pong example

To build: `make`

To run (locally):
   * You will need a running geth node as well as accounts holding some Ether.
     The geth node should have an open 8545 port for RPC.
     Edit `ping.ml` and `pong.ml` and substitute the `account` variables for the
     ones local to your private chain. 
   * build the examples via `make`
   * Run the `ping` and `pong` executables. You will be asked to input the passwords
     for the accounts provided at the first step.
   If the execution proceeds as it should, the `ping.sol` and `pong.sol` Solidity
   smart contracts will be deployed. The `OCaml` bridge will make them communicate.
