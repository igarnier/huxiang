A prototype for per-contract sharding. At its core, huxiang is a library for
functorially defined communicating state machines over TCP. The core feature
is the coalescent product construction, which allows to compute a process
acting as an interpreter for the asynchronous product of several processes
executing a distributed monitoring protocol (the "replica" protocol). 

For now, this code should certainly not be used for purposes beyond 
experimenting. The library provides a functor `Node.Make` parameterized by a
"process". A process specifies
1) which messages can be sent and received, and
2) a transition function from input to outputs.
Given a module of type `Process`, the `Node.Make` functor returns a module
for deploying an actual network node, ready to communicate and implement
the transition function.

The replica construction corresponds to the `Replica.Make` functor.
